Website shows a list of applicants (candidate number and name) for a job vacancy. 
This shows in a table with two columns. 

Four sample candidates documents were created. 

When you click on a name, it will open a document with that particular candidate's details.

When you hover over a name, the colour of the text changes from maroon to blue. 

There is a search bar on this website to search the details of candidates by their names or candidate number.

If the searched candidate is on the list, then it will return the correspondent candidate's document with the details.

If that candidate is not on the list, then it will open a page says 'record not found'.
